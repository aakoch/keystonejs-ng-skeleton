# KeystoneJS + AngularJS Skeleton

This project is intended to show how to build [KeystoneJS](http://keystonejs.com) apps that use [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) as front-end.

After cloning you just have to run:

    npm install
  
I'm using bower for installing angular, if it asks anything, use the version you want.
